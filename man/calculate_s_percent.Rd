\title{Calculate the S-Percent (Hart-Becking Spacing Index)}
\usage{
calculate_s_percent(h_top, N_at)
}
\arguments{
\item{h_top}{Numeric. The top height (dominant height) of the stand in meters.}

\item{N_at}{Numeric. The number of trees per hectare (stand density).}
}
\value{
Numeric. The calculated S-percent (spacing percentage), representing the relative spacing in the stand.
}
\description{
This function computes the S-percent (S\%), also known as the Hart-Becking Spacing Index,
which quantifies the degree of thinning in a forest stand. It is based on the average
top height of trees (\code{h_top}) and the number of trees per hectare (\code{N_at}).
}
\details{
The approximate formula used is:
\deqn{S\% = 10745.7 / (h_top * sqrt(N_at))}

The S-percent was introduced by Hart (1928) and approximates the ratio between spacing and tree height.
A higher S\% implies a more widely spaced (or thinned) stand. It is a key index in silviculture and thinning studies.

The approximation 10745.7 is derived from:
\deqn{100 * sqrt((10000 * 2) / (sqrt(3))) ≈ 10745.7}
}
\examples{
# Example: top height = 25 meters, 600 trees per hectare
calculate_s_percent(h_top = 25, N_at = 600)
