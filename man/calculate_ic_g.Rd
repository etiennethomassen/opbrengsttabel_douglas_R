\title{Calculate basal area increment (i_G) with updated cor_tgr
Formula 71 p81}
\usage{
calculate_ic_g(h_top_t1, h_top_t2, dt, tgr_0, x80, x_HD, c)
}
\arguments{
\item{h_top_t1}{Top height at time t1 (in meters)}

\item{h_top_t2}{Top height at time t2 (in meters)}

\item{dt}{Time interval (in years)}

\item{x80}{Indicator to identify if projection is for before(0) or after 1980(1)}

\item{x_HD}{Thinning indicator: 1 = thinning from above, 0 otherwise}

\item{c}{Named list of model parameters:
c5, c6, c7, c8, c9, c10, c51, c52, c53, c54, c55, c56, c57}

\item{tgr0}{Tree growth ratio (numeric)}
}
\value{
Annual increment i_G (numeric scalar, m/year)
}
\description{
Computes the annual height increment i_G between two time points,
adjusted for thinning, growth ratio, and recording year.
Incorporates updated logic for the cor_tgr correction as per Equation 70 variant.
